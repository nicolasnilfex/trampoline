Water trampoline. You must have heard of water bouncers and water trampolines. Both these units are slightly different with reference to portability. A water trampoline comes with springs in a steel frame that supports the main jumping area. On the other hand, a water bouncer utilizes only a webbing that is connected to the bouncing area with a flotation tube.

What do you need to look for when purchasing a water trampoline?

* look for one that has PVC vinyl tubing for the inflatable ring
* water trampoline has UV protection
* heat-welded seams
* galvanized steel frames so that it is strong and it lasts
* carrying handles if water trampoline is large
* check the load capacity â€“ for example, water <a href="http://trampolinecare.com/best-rectangle-trampoline-review">trampoline</a> have limited load capacity and are only suitable for children

This is a much more competitive market with many inferior products. Be sure that you check the thickness and material of the inflatable tube. Heavy gauge PVC is the best. Seams must be heat welded. Look for a heavy duty but pliable mat. All materials must be UV resistant. You can see and feel the difference in a quality product. You will need a lot of space around the water trampoline, away from boat traffic and docks. Water trampoline is designed to be used only on land or in large bodies of water with depths of at least 8 feet of water. You will need a location that is most protected from wind, of sufficient water depth, and free of obstructions above and below the water. You will need a high speed inflator to get the tube properly inflated. Because water trampoline are lighter weight, anchoring is quite easy and a portable anchor is usually provided with the kit. You will need 50 to 80 lbs of weight.
